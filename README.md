# Vanilla-Advanced
Vanilla Advanced is a fabric modpack designed to provide an enhanced Vanilla Minecraft experience while staying close to the current version of the game.
Serveral mods for improved world generation, more items, mobs and quality of life improvements are included.

Over the time we will continue to test and add mods.
We will also keep the server list up to date to add further performance improvements and integrations on the server side of things.

Current version is **Minecraft Java Edition 1.19.2**

## Installation

### Fabric
Installing this modpack is super easy once fabric is set up.
To install fabric please follow the instructions on [their website](https://fabricmc.net/).
The fastest for unexperienced modders is to use their [fabric installer](https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/)

### Installing the mods
After installing fabric simply navigate to your Minecraft mods folder and move all the files in there.
To quickly find your mods folder do the following:
1. Press Win + R
2. Paste the following path %appdata%\\.minecraft\\
3. Hit enter

In a standard environment you will now find yourself in your Minecraft folder.
Navigate to the "mods" folder or create it if not there.
After that simply move all files from the "Vanilla Advanced" folder into your "mods" folder.
