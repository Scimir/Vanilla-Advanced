# Vanilla-Advanced
Vanilla Advanced is a fabric modpack designed to provide an enhanced Vanilla Minecraft experience while staying close to the current version of the game.
Serveral mods for improved world generation, more items, mobs and quality of life improvements are included.

Over the time we will continue to test and add mods.
We will also keep the server list up to date and aim to add further performance improvements and integrations on the server side of things.

Current version is **Minecraft Java Edition 1.19.2**

## Installation

### Fabric
Installing this modpack is super easy once fabric is set up.
To install fabric please follow the instructions on [their website](https://fabricmc.net/).
The fastest way for unexperienced modders and experts alike is to use their [fabric installer](https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/)

### Installing the mods
You can find the latest files [here](https://github.com/Scimir/Vanilla-Advanced/releases/latest).
Download the zip file at the bottom of the page by clicking on it and unzip it once it finished downloading.
After you unpacked it, you'll find two folders:
* Vanilla Advanced - Includes all the mods that you can simply drag in your "mods" folder
* Vanilla Advanced Server - Also includes the server side mods for fabric Minecraft servers

Afterwards you can simply copy all the mods from the "Vanilla Advanced" folder into your "mods" folder.
To quickly find your Minecraft folder do the following:
1. Press Win + R
2. Paste the following path %appdata%\\.minecraft\\
3. Hit enter

In a standard environment you will now find yourself in your Minecraft folder.
Navigate to the "mods" folder or create it if not there.
After that simply move all files from the "Vanilla Advanced" folder into your "mods" folder.

Now start up the game and enjoy!

## Shaders
This modpack works with Iris shaders.
Since Iris can be troublesome with some of the mods, we include a working version into our pack.
All thats left to do is to simply download your favourite shader and add it to your "shaderpacks" folder :)

We recommend the Complementary Shaders!
